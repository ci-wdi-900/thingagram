# Thingagram

### Introduction

What happens when you assign a project where your students make a responsive photo album site, and the theme is up to them?

It becomes entitled Thingagram.


### What Is It Though

This project will be a responsive photo album within a responsive site ([wrapped in an enigma](https://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/31000.html)).

You'll need two total grids:

1. A responsive grid of photos along a theme (up to you what it is!).
2. A responsive holy grail layout with a header, footer, and nav bar, with the photo album being the content area.


What should be in your header and footer and nav bar? Up to you, but the generic suggestion is:
* The header could have a title and/or logo.
* The footer could have the authorship information, including a link to the GitHub repo.
* The nav bar could have a link to a separate, simple about page.

Stretch goals:

* Write a README outlining what your challenges and goals were, and how you overcome the first and achieved the second. Talk about the code and layout tools you used.
* Make the about page the html version of the above README.
